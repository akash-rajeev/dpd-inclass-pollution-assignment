# Statement and Supporting Premise

Statement: The Pollution data in this dataset is right skewed.

Supporting Premise: The histogram and boxplot demonstrate that the data may exhibit a skew to the right. Additionally, the mean is greater than the median, which may also indicate a slight right skew.
